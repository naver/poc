# grounded-sam-osx
This is a submodule of [Grounded-SAM](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything). It can estimate full-body pose and shape from a monuculor image. The combination of Grounded-SAM and OSX supports promptable 3D whole-body mesh recovery.  Please refer to this [repo](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OSX) to use the full code of OSX.
